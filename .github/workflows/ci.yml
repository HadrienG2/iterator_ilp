# There are two kinds of continuous integration jobs in this project:
#
# - Every code submission or master push passes continuous integration on the
#   minimal supported Rust version and the current stable Rust version.
# - Two times a month, a scheduled job makes sure that the code remains
#   compatible and lint-free on upcoming Rust toolchains (beta and nightly).

  pull_request:
